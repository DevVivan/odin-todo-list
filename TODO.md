# A todo list, for a todo list

This markdown file serves as a todo list, well, for my todo list project! It aids me in keeping a track and log of the steps I have taken when working on this project. These 'todo's' below can also be viewed as potential future commits!

## JavaScript Todo's

- [ ] Refactor todo `priority` and `project` dropdowns from modal to be created using JavaScript as opposed to HTML.
- [ ] DOM creation of todo's and integrate using data.
- [ ] Project switching logic.
- [ ] Create logic to change color for different todo priorities.
- [ ] Utilise the `date-fns` external library to format dates and times.

## CSS Todo's

- [ ] Change width of `<hr>` tags in modals to take up the full width of the modal container.
- [ ] Create custom property for `text dark` and utilise it where required.
- [ ] Basic responsiveness for when in and not in chrome's full page view.
- [ ] Create modal entry and exit animations.

## HTML Todo's

- [ ] Create the modal for editing todo's.
- [ ] Make it so that when in a modal, clicking anywhere outside modal view will close the modal and remove it from the screen.
